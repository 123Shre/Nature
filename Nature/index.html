                    The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 authorizes the central government to protect and improve environmental quality, control and reduce pollution from all sources, and prohibit or restrict the setting and /or operation of any industrial facility on

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across different countries. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments
                to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes
                legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage
                environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental acts. These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements
                being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa.</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Many constitutions acknowledge Tanzania is recognised as having some of the greatest biodiversity of any African country. Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas, including several national parks.[9] The
                concerns for the natural environment include damage to ecosystems and loss of habitat resulting from population growth, expansion of subsistence agriculture, pollution, timber extraction and significant use of timber as fuel. Environmental
                protection in Tanzania began during the German occupation of East Africa (1884-1919)—colonial conservation laws for the protection of game and forests were enacted, whereby restrictions were placed upon traditional indigenous activities
                such as hunting, firewood collecting, and cattle grazing.[11] In the year 1948, Serengeti has officially established the first national park for wild cats in East Africa. Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage
                environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental acts.Zebras at the Serengeti savana plains in northern part of Tanzania Division
                of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection.

                research. The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year 1983. This council has the role to advise governments and the international
                community on a range of environmental issues.</p>
